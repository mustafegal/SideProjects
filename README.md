# SideProjects
In these projects, I wanted to create something where I practiced some of the coding aspects I was learning through my java programming class. While I used some of the same coding techniques as I learned in the class, I wanted to apply them towards ideas I found interesting. I plan on showcasing all of my side projects here in this github so I can have a public space dedicated to what I am currently working on.
